# SimpleWarChallangeGame

A simple, fun, and interactive card game built with **SwiftUI**. This project was created to practice state management, UI layout, and logic in Swift.

## 🕹️ How it Works
The game is a digital version of the classic card game "War":
1. Tap the **Deal** button to draw cards for the Player and the CPU.
2. The side with the higher card value wins the round.
3. The score updates in real-time.

## 🚀 Features
* **Dynamic UI:** Built entirely with SwiftUI for a responsive experience.
* **State Management:** Uses `@State` properties to track scores and card images.
* **Randomization:** Logic to pull random card assets from the image catalog.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Swift**
* **SwiftUI**
* **Xcode**
